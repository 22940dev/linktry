# Commits "Rules"

I want to do something an experimental

When committing to a branch, Emojis will be used representing a new feature, bug or something related to the core project

## To contribute

When you want to contribute, you only need to clone the repository (you can follow the steps in the (README.md)[./README.md])

Create a new branch with some descriptive but short title

And when making your **commits** you can make use of the following emojis to specify what it is about:

🐞: _Bug fixed o TODO_ -> Fix

✨: _New feature o enhancement_ -> Feat

📦: _Something related to the core of the project_ -> Core

🏢: -> Build

📔: -> Docs

🖊: -> Refactor
